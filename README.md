# Spatial Land Use Patterns in Brazil

This project explores spatial patterns of land use in Brazil using a hexagonal H3 grid and environmental drivers such as climate and elevation.

The goal is to identify meaningful territorial patterns based on land-use composition and to understand how environmental variables help explain these patterns — moving beyond descriptive maps toward analytical spatial insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a reproducible spatial data pipeline from raw data to analysis
- Aggregate land-use and environmental variables using an H3 grid
- Identify spatial patterns using clustering techniques
- Explain land-use patterns with environmental drivers
- Deliver results through an interactive analytical app
